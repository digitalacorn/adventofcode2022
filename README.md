# Advent of Rust

I decided to look at Rust and that Advent of Code would be a good way to learn some basics.

Messed with structure types, fiddled with traits.

Blatant cut and paste of the file-reader code from stackoverflow.

Liked the operator overload for adding food to an Elf.

I got myself into a bit of a mess using `Vec` types so went with a statically sized array an part 2.

Still gettnig my head around pass-by-ref etc. (It's been many a year since I did any C++).

I like the idea of the Ok/Result types and used this as a side effect to detect the blank lines... a bit dirty.

Far from the most elegant of solutions, especially so in part 2 - I guess there are nice reducer type functionalities to discover.

Two correct answers though.
